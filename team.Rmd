## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(readxl)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
acc1 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
acc2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/person.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(acc1)
str(acc2)
```

## 1. number of accidents
```{r}
one <- table(acc1$DAY_WEEK)
one
```
Looking at the table numbers 1,7, and 6 there is a spike in more accidents. This could be because people are out and about on the weekend since they dont have school or work that day or the next day.

##2. Data frame of people fatally injured
```{r}
two <- acc2 %>% filter(INJ_SEV == '4')
summary(two)
```

##3. Data 
```{r}
three <- acc2 %>% group_by(MAKE, STATE) %>% drop_na(MAKE) %>% summarise(big_car = n())
three <- three %>% group_by(STATE) %>% filter(big_car == max(big_car)) %>% arrange(STATE)
head(three)
```
##4. Map
```{r}
states <- read_excel('../ds202_lab5/easyName.xlsx')
states <- states %>% rename(Name = 'State Name', STATE = 'State Code')
states <- states %>% distinct( Name, STATE) %>% mutate(STATE = as.integer(STATE))
three <- three %>% inner_join(states)
make <-  read_excel('../ds202_lab5/makeCodes.xlsx')
three <- three %>% mutate(State = tolower(Name))


statesOut <- map_data('state')
three <- three %>% inner_join(statesOut , by = c('State' = 'region'))
 three <- three %>% inner_join(make , by = c('MAKE'='Codes'))
 
ggplot(statesOut, aes(x=long, y=lat)) + geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) + geom_text(data=three, aes(label = Make), size = 1)
```
 
##5. join data
```{r} 
five <- acc1 %>% right_join(acc2)
str(five)

```

data is joined by variable ST_CASE

##6.Tally number of accidents
```{r}
six <- five %>% drop_na(DAY_WEEK,HOUR) %>%filter(SEX != 9) %>% filter(SEX != 8)%>% select(DAY_WEEK, HOUR, SEX) %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK, HOUR, SEX) %>% tally()
six
six$DAY_WEEK <- wday(six$DAY_WEEK, label = TRUE)
ggplot(six , aes(DAY_WEEK, n, fill = SEX)) +geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity") + labs(y = "accidents", x = "Days") +facet_wrap(~HOUR) +coord_flip()
```

##7. Plot of county Deaths
```{r}
states <- read_excel('../ds202_lab5/easyName.xlsx')
states <- states %>% rename(Name = 'State Name', STATE = 'State Code', CoName = 'County Name', CoCode = 'County Code')
states <- states %>% distinct( Name, STATE,CoName,CoCode) %>% mutate(STATE = as.integer(STATE), CoCode= as.integer(CoCode))

 county <- five %>%
  select(STATE, INJ_SEV, COUNTY, LATITUDE, LONGITUD)%>% filter(INJ_SEV == 4) %>%
  left_join(states) %>% group_by(STATE, COUNTY, LATITUDE, LONGITUD)


ggplot(statesOut, aes(x=long, y=lat)) + geom_polygon(aes(group=group)) + geom_polygon(data = county,
               aes(x = LONGITUD, y = LATITUDE)) 
```

couldnt get the map to work, but each row is a death in the data frame. I was meaning to grab each rows lat and lon and plot it on the map and the more in each state and group the more it got red/ whatever color i chose
